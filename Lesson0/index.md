# Lesson 0 - Web Fundamentals

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - **NB!** MDN is an excellent resource for web development. Bookmark it!
- [Learn to code HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) - highly recommended to go through this too.

## HTML
- **HTML** is the **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage used to create webpages. HTML is used to "mark up" the content in a document, and a web browser uses this markup to display the page *elements*.
- [Introduction to HTML on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) - some great guides here, please go through them. At the *very least* go through [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
- HTML *tags* use the angle brackets generally around the *content*, that defines an HTML *element*.
